1. Read through the man pages to find this option.
2. Utilized whereis to find where the programs where located
3. Used find together with the wildcard ? to find files of one char long
4. Used symbolic link to discover it. (ls -l) 
5. The man pages of chmod specified what those commands do. 
6. I first tried find -mtime 3, but it wouldn't find any files because they had to be modified in exactly 3 days. Then I used find -mtime -3. 
9. Used find together with a formatting style that included the timestamp and the filename, piped that into sort and piped that into head. 
10. Found the answer by reading through the man pages. 
11. Looked at the Emacs documentation to look for this. 
12. While on the Emacs Shell, I pressed all the keystrokes and wrote down what they did. 
13. I played around with C-g to see different use cases. I tried using it in the middle of a command, in a line, etc. 
14. Found this in combination with kill. 
15. Opened two different terminal windows and performed a visual comparison. Later I created a .diff file that highlighted the differences between those two.
