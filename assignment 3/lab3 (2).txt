1. Used wget {url} to grab the tar file of coreutils. 
2. then I unzipped it using tar -xvf
3. read the documentation (configure) to understand how the \
general implementation of coreutils is.
4. running   ./configure ; make  creates the makefile
5. I use both ls and ./ls to notice the difference in the date format
6. Read Brady's patch and made the necessary changes to the ls.c file
7. Running make again outputs the following (excluding all \
   the "entering/leaving directory" lines):
make  all-recursive   =  tries to run make on all the files needed
Making all in lib
  GEN    configmake.h
make  all-recursive
  GEN    configmake.h  
Making all in src     
make  all-am          = all these commands are not needed
Making all in doc
Making all in man
Making all in po
Making all in tests
Making all in gnulib-tests
make  all-recursive


  CC     ls.o   = detects that ls.c changed, so it creates the object file
  CCLD   dir
  CCLD   vdir
  CCLD   ls



  GEN    dir.1
  GEN    vdir.1
  GEN    ls.1
