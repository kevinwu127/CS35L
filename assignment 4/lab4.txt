Got a copy of the repo
Dumped the log into a text file using git log
Dumped the tags into git-tags.txt using git tag
Created the patch wit the following
> git format-patch -1 <hased log key> --stdout > ../quote-patch.txt
Checked out a previously created branch
> git checkout v3.0
Tried to apply the patch
> patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt
Applied the patch, skipping over some files.
Using git status, I looked at which files \
changed after the patch was applied
> git status
Shows which files were modified and untracked.
> inspected all the non .c files
 C-x v = C-x v u to undo all the comment changes
 Now in all the .c files
  C-x v = to open diff buffer
   undo all the hunks
    manualy inspected every file in *.c.rej
    Changed all the sections that were not previously found
    Ran git clean -n  and git clean -f to remove untracked files
    As instructed by the README-hacking I ran the following
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    ./make

Verifying that it does the right thing..
cd src
./diff . -
 which should show errors with single quotes ''
 ./diff --help3
   should show help with ''

Create directories for the patch
mkdir ../diffutils-3.0-patch
mkdir ../diffutils-3.0
and moving src folder to
cp * ../diffutils-3.0-patch
Repeat above steps after checking out v3.0 and run
diffutils-3.0-patch/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.

15.The files are indeed different. (200 loc)
The difference lies in the string literals, so not innocous.
