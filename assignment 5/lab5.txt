Downloaded and uzipped the file with tar xvf.
Tried to build it running ./configure CFLAGS="-g -O0"
> make  but the build failed.
Downloaded the patch using wget and
applied it using ' patch -p0 < coreutils.diff ', this time succeeded
creating the executables.

To recreate the bug, I touched the three files with the appropiate timestamps
The error is that wwi-armistice shows at the top \
when it should be at the bottom based on a chronological sorting.

DEBUGGING
Started a session in gdb. The hint was to look into the comparing \
function of qsort. I opened ls.c in emacs and ran gdb with: 'M-x gdb' and 'gdb --anotate3 ./ls`. Set breakpoints where I deemed useful using ‘b’ (i.e. b sort_files).
Stepping through each time using s or n.

After some careful evaluation and multiple stepping through and re-runs, I ended up looking at the timespec.h file.
Printing the values of the variables showed that wwi-armistice stored a
negative number whereas and ‘now’ a positive value. I inspected this issue using
gdb to look at the variables. It seemed that a substraction of a negative number
to a positive one caused overflow.

To fix this bug, I declared variables big enough to prevent this error inside
timespec.h. A signed long long int worked in this case.
The logic of this function will return 1,0 or -1, depending on the calculation.

Recompiling coreutils with the patched file resolved the issue.

ON SEAS

wwi-armistice was taken as though it had been created in a future date.
The root of the problem is that SEASnet servers use 64bit, while the files that
I create are saved (read truncated) as 32bit. The sign of the timestamp is lost
at this operation. Therefore, the file is assigned a positive numbered timestamp
that corresponds to the future.
