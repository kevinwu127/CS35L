AMAZON EC2

1. Created a server instance by following the instructions on the Amazon site.
2. Generated and downloaded a key pair  
3. chmod 400 key.pem
4. Transfered the files to the server
   scp -i key.pem -r sthttpd-2.26.4 ec2-user@54.68.29.152:~
   scp -i key.pem wget.sh  ec2-user@54.68.29.152:~
5. ssh'ed into the server
   ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@54.68.29.152
(All the following commands were run in the server)
6. sudo su
7. yum install gcc
8. cd sthttpd-2.26.4/src
9. Applied the patch to thttpd.c as in the lab
10. ran configure with CFLAGS="-g"
11. make
12. verified that everything worked with a simple wget 
13. Crashed the server with a long wget 
14. Followed exactly everything listed on lab.txt.  




VULNERABILITIES
In order of seriousness (most urgent at the top):

1. VU#213119 Microsoft Windows Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) fails to properly validate Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) signature

  Given that the user could get admin privileges, this is the worst damage that could be caused,
 as the hacker could compromise any computer on the network. 
  Also, an update has been released by the Microsoft Team, which makes it easy to fix. 


2. VU#720951 OpenSSL TLS heartbeat extension read overflow discloses sensitive information
 
  Heartbleed. With this vulnerability, a hacker can get access to private and
sensitive information such as secret keys, usernames and passwords. By
leveraging this information, an attacker may be able to decrypt, spoof, or
perform man-in-the-middle attacks on network traffic that would otherwise be
protected by OpenSSL. This is extremely risky as communications will become
unprotected, and data will be compromised. 

  To protect against this, we need to regenerate keys, usernames and
passwords. Also, OpenSSL released a solution to this issue.  

3. VU#505120 Microsoft Secure Channel (Schannel) vulnerable to remote code execution via
specially crafted packets 

  This vulnerability allows a hacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. This
is really dangerous as the hacker can execute code at any point in time
without having to wait for any sort of user interaction.
  An update has been released to fix this issue.


4. VU#252743 GNU Bash shell executes commands in exported functions in environment
variables

  The hacker can execute arbitrary code at the privilege level of the calling
application.
  No comprehensive patch has been released to fully address this bug, so this
will take some time to fix.


5. VU#447516 Linksys SMART WiFi firmware contains multiple vulnerabilities
 
  The hacker can read and modify the router information with a simple HTTP
request. This could allow the hacker to enter our network and steal sensitive
information. Although this is a problem, it is not as dangerous as the issues
listed above. 
  Linksys has released patches for this.
